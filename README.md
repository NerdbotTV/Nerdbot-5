# Nerdbot-5
Previously undisclosed source code for Nerdbot 5, a Twitch bot which grew amazingly fast (apparently becoming top-5 in 6 months) but has since shut down.

This code was written when I was pretty much just starting out. It was a project that became a lot more than I expected, which meant I unfortunately had to end it when it was doing its best. This code is probably terrible (I have not read it in a while), but hopefully it's useful to at least someone.
